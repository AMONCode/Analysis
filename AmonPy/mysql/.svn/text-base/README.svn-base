1) db_build.sql is a script that creates AMON_test1 database for archival data

2) db_mc_build.sql is a script that creates AMON_test2 database for MC data

To run, use:

mysql -u username -h hostname -p dbname < scriptname

Attention: by running these two scripts on db.hpc.rcc.psu.edu you will erase current AMON 
databases. Use these scripts to create databases on your own machine (i.e. localhost).
