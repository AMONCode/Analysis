First create new user for AMON:

$ mysql -u root -p [-h hostname]
> CREATE USER '<AMONUSERNAME>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';

(Replace 'localhost' with 'hostname' if MySQL is not running on you local
machine)

Then you can create databases by doing:

$ ./create_db.sh <DATABASE> <AMONUSERNAME>

You will need to set up two databases for testing: AMON_test1 and AMON_test2

Attention: by running this on db.hpc.rcc.psu.edu you will erase current AMON
databases. Use these scripts to create databases on your own machine (i.e.
localhost).
