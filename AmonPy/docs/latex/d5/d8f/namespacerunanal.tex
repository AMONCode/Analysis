\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb} This is a top level task that gets initialized
 at the time that AMON server starts running.\end{DoxyVerb}
 It receives event stream number, event number and event revision from the A\-M\-O\-N server in real-\/time (A\-M\-O\-N server calls task function Anal\-R\-T.\-run every time a new events comes from the outside world) Upon reception of these three parameters, a new event is read from the D\-B and passed to the main analysis code using Python multiprocessing module.

Works with the Enthought Canopy package management, Rabitt\-M\-Q server as a broker for messages and Celery allowing from transport of messages from A\-M\-O\-N server to this worker program.

To run (outside this directory called analizer)\-:

celery worker --app=analyser -\/l info

where \hyperlink{dbaccess_8txt}{dbaccess.\-txt} contans a string in dictionary format, containing the information required to access the database

Each alert will be saved to D\-B, and also written to X\-M\-L file (in V\-O\-Event format) to the directory /network/server\-\_\-events. A\-M\-O\-N client will send this events in the future to G\-C\-N and delete each xml fiel after it has been sent.
