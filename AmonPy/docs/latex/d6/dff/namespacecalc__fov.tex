\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb} This is a top level script to run basic
 simulations for triggering observatories.\end{DoxyVerb}
 It also injects a doublet of events that will form a triplet with a randomly chosen simulated event i.\-e. fake signal triplet

Works with the Enthought Canopy package management

Example\-: $>$ python \hyperlink{calc__fov_8py}{calc\-\_\-fov.\-py} \hyperlink{dbaccess_8txt}{dbaccess.\-txt}

where \hyperlink{dbaccess_8txt}{dbaccess.\-txt} contans a string in dictionary format, containing the information required to access the database Modified to print Field of View overlap between streams 0, 1, 3 and 7 (Ice\-Cube, A\-N\-T\-A\-R\-E\-S, Auger and H\-A\-W\-C)
