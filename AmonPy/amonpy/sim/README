This directory contain simulation code. 
This code is run by scrips in ../ops directory. 

The package sidereal.py is taken from 
http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/sidereal/

However, it contains a small bug that causes divide by zero errors for 
Icecube (due to the pole). A modified version of the code is contained
in sidereal_m.py, which avoids this problem. 

The original code sidereal.py is archived here for reference, 
but is not used for AmonPy
