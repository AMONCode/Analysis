\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb} Generates a relatively simple simulation of sme high energy observatories
 The following crude assumptions are made:

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Circular F\-O\-V
\item Constant event rate across F\-O\-V
\item Fixed error for P\-S\-F
\item Observatory is fixed to the Earth and cannot change its pointing
\item No skymap is used (i.\-e. P\-S\-F is analytic)
\item Run simulation with injected coincidence signal, if desired, with function signal\-\_\-inject
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
